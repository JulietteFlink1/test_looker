# 01 LookML Development Guidelines



## üè† General LookML
1. Use **explicit [includes][1] for view and explore files** - do not use wildcards (*)
2. Structure **files into folders**
3. Use the **['label'][2] and ['group_label'][3] parameters** to apply business-friendly names (where business-friendly names do not exist for fields, views or explores)
-- Add descriptions to provide more information to the end user
4. Use **lowercase letters and underscores** for spaces in all LookML objects
5. **Use [sets][7]** to define a group of fields centrally and use for [drill_fields][18] and [fields][19]
6. Do not create too many views/explores/dimensions for first pass (**start simple** and expand later)
7. The project is **consistently formatted**
8. **[Refinements][4]** for base layer:
-- For projects where the underlying data model is clean and controlled, the base layer should contain the raw fields and all descriptions, labels etc
-- For data sources which are standardised or highly customisable (SalesForce), and the structure is not controlled by the data team, the enhancements should be created in a refinement
9. Ensure no errors and clean [content validator][5] when pushing code to production


## ü§ù Naming Conventions
[Please see here](/projects/flink_v1/files/02_naming_conventions.md)


## üîé Views
1. Ensure **all views have a [primary key][6]**, that is unique
2. Ensure the **file name and view name are the same**
3. **One view per view file**
2. **Hide dimensions and measures** that do not need to be surfaced to the end user
3. **Group fields within the LookML**, to make developing LookML as simple as possible for other developers and admins
-- Group fields into (1) columns from the table, (2) custom dimensions, (3) [liquid parameters/templated filters][20], (4) custom measures, (5) [sets][7]
4. Ensure all **date fields are [dimension_groups][8]**, rather than dimensions
5. **For PDTs, use [datagroups][9] and ['datagroup_trigger'][10]** over ['persist_for'][11]


## üß≠ Explores
1. Create individual **[.explore files][12] for each explore**. Include these in the relevant model
2. Choose **['view_name'][13] over 'from'**, unless the view is being joined in the explore multiple times
3. Ensure **['type'][14], ['sql_on'][15] and ['relationship'][16] are defined for joins**
4. Use **many_to_one joins where possible**
5. Use **_raw timeframe for joins**
5. **Hide explores** that do not need to be surfaced to the end user. For example, if the explore is used for a specific Look or tile

## üìú Manifest file
1. **Define custom formats and other constants centrally** in a [Manifest file][17]
