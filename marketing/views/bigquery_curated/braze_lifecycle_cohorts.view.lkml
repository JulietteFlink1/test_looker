  # === Incrementality in Customers Ordered

  #
  #
  # For calculation of incrementality we need to compare variant variation's performance with respective control group's performance.
  # Association of control group's performance metrics with variant variations is already done in dbt model.
  # That's why each cohort record has two sets of performance metrics:
  # a) primary (describing this variation cohort's performance)
  # b) and control (that describe respective control group performance).
  #
  # Incrementality should be calculated only for variant variations, that's why we are using is_control_group = "No" filter conditions.
  # This filtering logic and usage of intermediate hidden measures alows us to split primary and control metrics into respective _variant_ and _control_ groups.
  # Later we use them to calculate performance of variant and control cohorts and derive incrementality without dependency on other records.
